![Chocolate Chip Cookies](../assets/choc-cookies.jpg)

#### Yield
Makes approximately 48 cookies

#### Prep Time
15 minutes

#### Cook Time
9-11 minutes per batch

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt

### Wet Ingredients
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

### Mix-ins
- 2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)
- 1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat your oven** to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Mix dry ingredients** in a medium bowl. Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. **Cream butter and sugars** in a large bowl using an electric mixer. Beat softened butter with both granulated and brown sugar until light and fluffy (about 2-3 minutes).

4. **Add eggs and vanilla** to the butter mixture. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract. Mix until well combined.

5. **Combine wet and dry ingredients** by gradually adding the flour mixture to the butter mixture. Mix on low speed until just combined - don't overmix.

6. **Fold in chocolate chips** and nuts (if using) with a wooden spoon or spatula until evenly distributed.

7. **Shape the cookies** by dropping rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. **Bake for 9-11 minutes** or until the edges are golden brown but centers still look slightly soft.

9. **Cool on baking sheets** for 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips for Perfect Cookies

- **Room temperature ingredients** mix more easily and create better texture
- **Don't overbake** - cookies continue cooking on the hot pan after removal
- **Chill the dough** for 30 minutes if it's too soft to handle
- **Use parchment paper** for easier cleanup and even browning

## Storage

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week. For longer storage, freeze the baked cookies for up to 3 months or freeze the dough balls for up to 2 months.
