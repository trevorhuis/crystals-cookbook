# Sweet Potato and Chorizo Sausage Bites Recipe

**Total:** 1 Hour, 20 Minutes | **Yield:** Serves 12 (serving size 4 sausage balls)

## Ingredients

- 1 pound fresh Mexican chorizo sausage, casings removed
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose baking mix (such as Bisquick)
- 1 (8-oz.) pkg. pre-shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup chilled mashed roasted sweet potato
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons plum jam or scuppernong jelly
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet.

2. Stir together sausage, baking mix, cheese, mashed sweet potato, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Roll into 48 (1 1/2-inch) balls, and place about 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until sausage balls are cooked through and deep golden brown, about 20 minutes.

3. Stir together jelly and mustard in a small bowl until well blended. (If your jelly is too stiff to blend, microwave mixture at HIGH in 15-second increments until soft enough to stir.) Serve with sausage balls.

## Note
Sausage balls can be frozen on baking sheet and transferred to ziplock plastic freezer bags for storage. Bake from frozen. (You may need to add 1 or 2 minutes to baking time.)
