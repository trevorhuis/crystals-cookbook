# Air Fryer Armadillo Eggs

## Ingredients

- 8 large jalapeño peppers

### Cream Cheese Mixture

- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- ½ cup cheddar cheese, shredded
- ½ teaspoon garlic minced

### Sausage Mixture

- 1 pound pork sausage
- 1 pound Italian sausage
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- ½ teaspoon garlic, minced
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon Kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
- 16 slices bacon

## Directions

1.  Preheat an air fryer to 400°F.

### Jalapeno Peppers

1.  Remove the stem and use a paring knife to carefully remove the insides of the jalapeno peppers.

2.  Fill a large saucepan halfway with water set it over high heat until boiling.

3.  Add the jalapeños to the boiling water for 5 minutes.

4.  Drain the water and remove the jalapeno peppers. Allow them to cool enough to touch.

### Cream Cheese Mixture

1.  In a medium bowl combine cream cheese, cheese, and garlic and mix until well blended.

2.  Stuff each hollowed-out jalapeño with the cream cheese mixture, all the way to the top.

### Sausage Mixture

1.  In a medium bowl, mix together pork sausage, Italian sausage, brown sugar, garlic, onion powder, salt, and pepper.

### Assembly

1.  Scoop out ½ cup of the meat mixture and make a disc (or patty) shape. Wrap the disc around the stuffed jalapeño, sealing it inside. (It should look like an egg).

2.  Wrap two slices of bacon around the outside of the meat, and secure with a toothpick as needed. Repeat with the remaining jalapeños.

3.  Working in batches, add the armadillo eggs to the air fryer basket. Bake for 15 minutes. Then, flip and cook for an additional 10 minutes. The appetizer is done when the internal temperature of the sausage is 160°F and the bacon is crispy.
