# Banana Macadamia Muffins

These muffins taste even better the next day, so to save time, I often make them the night before. They stay moist for days.

## Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 cups sugar
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 cup canola oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 medium ripe bananas, mashed
- 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
- 1 can (8 ounces) crushed pineapple, drained
- 1 cup macadamia nuts

## Directions

1. Preheat oven at 375Â°. In a large bowl, combine the first 5 ingredients. In another bowl, combine the eggs, oil and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients until just moistened. Fold in the bananas, coconut and pineapple.

2. Fill greased or paper-lined muffin cups two-thirds full. Sprinkle with nuts. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks.
