## Ingredients

### For the Remoulade

- 1/4 cup Creole mustard, or other whole-grain spicy mustard
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley

### For the Boudin Balls
- 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 pounds pork sausage, removed from casing
- 1/2 pound chicken livers, chopped
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 cups cooked rice
- 2 jalapeños, seeded and minced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne
- 2 scallions (green part only), chopped
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 2/3 cup flour
- Kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
- 2 cups panko breadcrumbs
- 2 large eggs
- Splash of milk
- Vegetable oil, for deep frying

## Directions

### For the Remoulade
1. Add all ingredients to a bowl and mix well. Refrigerate until chilled before serving, for 1 hour up to overnight.

### For the Boudin Balls
1. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, bell pepper, and a pinch of salt. Cook for about 6 to 7 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Set aside and let cool.

2. Combine ingredients from sausage through parsley in a large bowl. Add cooled onion mixture, and stir to thoroughly combine. Set aside while you set up your breading station.

3. In one shallow bowl, combine flour with 1 tablespoon of salt. In another, whisk eggs together with milk. In a third, combine breadcrumbs with Cajun seasoning.

4. With damp hands, roll 2 tablespoons each of sausage mixture into balls. Dredge the balls in the flour, then dip them in the egg wash, letting the excess drip off. Lastly, dredge the balls in the breadcrumbs, coating them evenly.

5. Transfer the boudin balls to a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to set.

6. Meanwhile, preheat the vegetable oil 350°F in a deep fryer or Dutch oven. Line another baking sheet with paper towels.

7. Using a slotted spoon or culinary spider and working in batches, slide the balls gently into the oil and fry until golden, 3 to 4 minutes, turning frequently to ensure even cooking. Move to the paper towel-lined baking sheet.

8. Serve boudin balls hot with chilled remoulade dipping sauce.
