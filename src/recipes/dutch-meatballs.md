# Dutch Meatballs - Gehaktballen met jus

## Ingredients

- 1 lb of ground beef, preferably 85/15 or half beef, half pork
- 2 slices of white bread
- 1/2 cup of milk
- 2 shallots or one small onion
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg ground
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, ground
- 2 tablespoons of prepared mustard
- 2 tablespoons of flour
- 4 tablespoons of butter

## Directions

1. Mince the shallots or small onion. Add the meat to a bowl, mix in the shallots, the egg, the mustard, nutmeg, the salt and pepper and knead a couple of times. Cut the crust off the bread, soak it in the milk and add it to the meat. Dispose of the rest of the milk.

2. When the mixture has come together, divide it in four equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, roll the meatballs through the flour and set aside.

3. Heat the butter in a Dutch oven and sear the meatballs on all sides until brown. Lower the heat, place the cover on the pan and let them simmer for a good twenty minutes, then turn them over in the grease and simmer for another ten. Add 1/2 cup of water to the pan, cover and simmer for another twenty minutes. Remove the meatballs from the pan, add 1/2 cup of beef stock to the pan and stir to loosen up all the meaty bits from the bottom of the pan. Taste and see if you need to adjust salt/pepper or bind the jus a little bit with cornstarch or flour, you decide.

4. Meatballs made one day ahead somehow always taste better the next day. Serve one meatball per person, and add a generous spoonful of jus on their potatoes for some good old-fashioned prakking.
