# Dutch Kroketten (Croquettes)

Make this the day before so it gets hard enough to form into logs.

## Ingredients

- 1 stick butter (4 oz)
- ½ cup + 2 tablespoons flour
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 stalk celery, finely chopped
- 1/3 cup parsley, finely chopped
- 1 lb 5 oz shredded chicken, turkey, or combo (christmas leftovers)
- 3 eggs, separated into yolks and whites
- 4 cups fine breadcrumbs
- vegetable oil, to deep-fry

## Directions

1. Melt the butter in a large dutch oven, stir in the flour and keep stirring for a few minutes on low heat. Don't let it brown. Slowly and gradually add the stock and cook over moderate heat, stirring until the sauce is smooth and thick. Add all the seasonings and lemon juice. Add more flour, or corn starch to thicken the sauce, if necessary.

2. Take off heat. Add onion, garlic, celery, parsley, chicken and/or turkey. Add egg yolks and save egg whites for frying later.

3. Refrigerate overnight. Make rolls 1.5" thick and about 3" long.

4. Spread the crumbs on a clean, dry chopping board. Slightly beat the egg whites in a deep plate until just incorporated. Roll the croquettes through the breadcrumbs, then through the egg whites and again through the crumbs. (Make sure that the second coating of crumbs is even and thick and no meat mix sticks out, otherwise the croquettes may burst when being deep fried).

5. Deep fry the croquettes in batches of four or five for about 4 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Drain on paper towels.

6. Serve hot, with French fries or fresh chunks of bread. The best way to season is to slather with mustard, as the Dutch do!
