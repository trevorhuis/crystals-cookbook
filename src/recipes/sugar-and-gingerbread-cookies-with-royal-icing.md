# Sugar and Gingerbread Cookies with Royal Icing

## Sugar Cookies

### Ingredients
- 2 sticks of butter -- room temperature
- 1 ½ cups powdered sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 2 ½ cups flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar

### Directions
1. Mix butter, powdered sugar, egg, vanilla, and almond extract until creamed.
2. Add flour, baking soda, and cream of tartar.
3. Refrigerate dough 2 hours and divide into two batches. Roll out and cut into shapes.
4. Bake @ 375 for about 7-8 minutes.

## Gingerbread Cookies

### Ingredients
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- ½ cup molasses
- 2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- ½ cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- ¼ teaspoon salt

### Directions
1. Combine first 7 ingredients in a 3-quart saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove pan from heat; stir in baking soda. Transfer to a mixing bowl. Add butter and egg, beating at medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually stir in flour and salt, beating just until blended.

2. Shape dough into a ball, and divide in half. Flatten each half into a round disk; wrap each in plastic wrap, and chill at least 1 hour or until firm.

3. Roll out dough, 1 section at a time, to ¼" thickness on a floured surface. Cut into gingerbread shapes. Reroll trimmings to make additional cookies. Place cutouts ½" apart on parchment lined baking sheets.

4. Bake 325 for 11-13 minutes or until cookies are puffed and slightly darker around the edges. Cool 1 minute on baking sheets; remove to wire racks to cool completely.

5. Cookies may be frozen with or without icing.

## Royal Icing (Stiff Consistency)

### Ingredients
- 3 level tablespoons Meringue Powder
- 1 lb. sifted pure cane confectioners' sugar
- 5-6 tablespoons lukewarm water

### Directions
1. Place confectioners' sugar and meringue powder in a bowl. Stir to mix at low speed until blended. Add water and mix 7-10 minutes at low-medium speed until icing loses its sheen. To prevent drying, be sure to cover the bowl with a damp cloth while working with icing.

2. Make small bowls of icing and add different gel food colors. You may have to add a little more water (1 tablespoon) to get it to the proper consistency for piping. To cover an area on a cookie, put ¼ of the colored icing into a piping bag. Pipe the outlines first. Let this dry. Take the rest of the colored icing and add more water to get it thin enough to squeeze out of a squeeze bottle. It is a sauce consistency (not watery). Squeeze some icing out and push it around with the end of the squeeze bottle to get the entire outlined area filled in. If using sprinkles, add them now before icing dries. If adding more colored icing decorations, let the bottom layer dry first.

3. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. To reuse, beat on low to restore original texture. Makes 3 cups.
