# Spiced Pumpkin-Pecan Pancakes

Just whisk the dry ingredients (including flour and warm spices of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves), then fold them into the wet mixture of pumpkin, milk, butter, and eggs. For extra fall flavor, we stir in some toasted pecans. Griddle your pancakes, and drizzle them with plenty of maple syrup.

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 3/4 teaspoon fine salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves

### Wet Ingredients
- 1 1/4 cups whole milk
- 1/2 cup pumpkin purée (not pie filling)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Mix-ins
- 1/2 cup toasted pecans, coarsely chopped

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together all dry ingredients.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, pumpkin purée, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract.

3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently fold together until just combined. Don't overmix.

4. Fold in the toasted pecans.

5. Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium heat. Cook pancakes using about 1/4 cup batter per pancake, until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 1-2 minutes more.

6. Serve hot with maple syrup.
