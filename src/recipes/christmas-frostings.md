# Christmas Frostings

## Eggnog Frosting

### Ingredients
- 1 cup sugar
- ¼ cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
- 1 cup eggnog
- ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 cup butter, softened
- Dash salt

### Directions
In 2-quart saucepan, stir together 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup flour with whisk. Beat in 1 cup eggnog and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg until no lumps remain. Heat mixture over medium heat, beating with whisk until mixture comes to a low boil and thickens enough to coat a spoon. Remove from heat; scrape mixture into bowl. Cool completely, about 45 minutes.

Using hand mixer or stand mixer, beat 1 cup butter and dash salt in large bowl until creamy. Pour in cooled eggnog mixture, beating until light and creamy. If Frosting looks curdled or separated, keep beating! It will come together after a few minutes.

## Cream Cheese Frosting

### Ingredients
- 1 package (8 oz) cream cheese, softened
- 6 tablespoons butter, softened
- 6 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1 tablespoon clear vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt

## Mascarpone Frosting

Makes 3 cups

### Ingredients
- 1 (8 oz) container mascarpone cheese
- ¼ cup powdered sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 cup whipping cream

### Directions
Whisk together first 3 ingredients in a large bowl until just blended. Beat whipping cream at medium speed until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into mascarpone mixture.

## Creamy Nutella Frosting

### Ingredients
- 1 cup (230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 2 cups (240g) confectioners' sugar
- 3/4 cup (222g) Nutella
- 3-4 tablespoons (45-60ml) heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- salt to taste

### Directions
Beat softened butter on medium speed until smooth and very creamy. Add 2 cups of powdered sugar and continue to beat on medium speed. The mixture will be fairly thick. Add the Nutella and continue to beat on medium speed. Add 3 tablespoons of heavy cream and the vanilla extract. If the frosting is too thick, add more heavy cream (1 tablespoon measurements at a time). If the frosting is too thin, add more powdered sugar (1/4 cup measurements at a time). Taste the frosting and add salt to cut the sweetness.
