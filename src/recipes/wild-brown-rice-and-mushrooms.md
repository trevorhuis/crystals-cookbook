# Wild and Brown Rice with Mushrooms

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 medium onion, diced
- 1 cup brown rice
- 4 oz wild rice (1 small Reeseâ€™s pkg)
- 4 1/2 cups chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 8 ounces white button mushrooms, sliced
- 8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, sliced with tough stems removed
- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley

## Directions

1. Heat 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large saucepot over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the wild rice only and toast while stirring until it begins to smell nutty, about 1 minute. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover and cook on low for about 10 minutes.   Then add the brown rice and simmer until the water is absorbed, about 40-45 minutes.

2. While the rice is cooking, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon butter along with the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the button mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms and thyme and cook, stirring often until they begin to brown, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, season with salt and pepper and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute more.

3. When the rice is cooked, fluff with a fork and gently fold in the mushrooms. Add to a serving bowl and sprinkle with the parsley before serving.
