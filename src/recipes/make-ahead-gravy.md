# Make Ahead Gravy

## Ingredients

- ¼ cup butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups stock (saved from cooking chicken for dressing)
- ½ teaspoon rubbed sage
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ¼ teaspoon pepper
- ¼ teaspoon dried thyme
- ¼ teaspoon garlic powder

## Directions

1. Melt butter in heavy medium saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour, and cook, whisking constantly, 3-4 minutes or until mixture is light brown and smooth.

2. Slowly whisk in 2 cups stock. Increase heat to high; bring to a boil, whisking occasionally. Reduce heat to medium; stir in spices. Simmer, stirring occasionally, 10 to 15 minutes or until desired thickness.

3. To make ahead, cool gravy completely. Cover and chill up to 3 days. May need a bit of stock when you reheat over med-low heat until hot.
