# Cranberry-Orange Muffins

Makes 10 muffins

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Grated zest of 1 orange
- 1 egg
- 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted, or walnut oil
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup strained fresh orange juice
- 1 1/2 cups fresh or unthawed frozen cranberries
- 1/2 cup pecans or walnuts, chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat an oven to 375Â°F. Grease 10 standard muffin cups with butter or butter-flavored nonstick cooking spray; fill the unused cups one-third full with water to prevent warping.

2. In a bowl, stir together the flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, salt and orange zest.

3. In another bowl, whisk together the egg, melted butter, milk and orange juice until blended. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, stirring just until evenly moistened. The batter will be slightly lumpy.

4. Using a large silicone spatula, fold in the cranberries and nuts just until evenly distributed, no more than a few strokes. Do not overmix. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling them level with the rim.

5. Bake the muffins until golden, dry and springy to the touch, and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let the muffins cool for 5 minutes. Remove the muffins from the pan and serve warm or at room temperature.
