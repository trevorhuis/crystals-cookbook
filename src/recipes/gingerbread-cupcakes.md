## Ingredients

### Cupcakes
- 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 1/2 cup (100g) packed light or dark brown sugar
- 1 large egg, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup (120ml) milk, at room temperature
- 1/2 cup (156g) molasses
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 and 1/3 cups (166g) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice

### Eggnog Frosting
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
- 1 cup eggnog
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 1 cup butter, softened
- Dash salt

## Directions

### Cupcakes
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 12-count muffin pan with cupcake liners. Set aside.

2. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium speed until creamy. Beat in the egg until combined, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Beat in the milk, molasses, and vanilla on medium speed. Mixture will be piecey and not fully combined. That's ok.

3. In a medium bowl, toss the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice together until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Mix until just combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.

4. Fill cupcake liners 2/3 of the way full, no more. Bake for 19-21 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. Allow to cool completely before frosting.

### Eggnog Frosting
1. In 2-quart saucepan, stir together 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup flour with whisk. Beat in 1 cup eggnog and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg until no lumps remain. Heat mixture over medium heat, beating with whisk until mixture comes to a low boil and thickens enough to coat a spoon. Remove from heat; scrape mixture into bowl. Cool completely, about 45 minutes.

2. Using hand mixer or stand mixer, beat 1 cup butter and dash salt in large bowl until creamy. Pour in cooled eggnog mixture, beating until light and creamy. If Frosting looks curdled or separated, keep beating! It will come together after a few minutes.

3. Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes. Store in refrigerator.

## Storage
Unfrosted cupcakes remain fresh covered tightly at room temperature for 2 days. Store frosted cupcakes in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days and allow to come to room temperature before serving.
