# Marinated Olives

## Ingredients

- 1 lb Mixed Olives (such as DeLallo Gigante Olives & DeLallo Jumbo Pitted Calamata Olives, drained & rinsed)
- 4 cloves Garlic (thinly sliced)
- 2 sprigs Rosemary
- 10 sprigs Thyme
- 1 Bay Leaf
- Lemon Rind (from 1/2 lemon)
- 1 teaspoon Red Chili Flakes (optional, crushed)
- 1 cup Olive Oil

## Directions

1. Layer the olives, garlic, herbs, bay leaf, lemon rind, & chili flakes in a 16-ounce jar (or 16-ounce airtight container of choice). Slowly pour the olive oil over top, just until the olives are submerged. Depending on the size of your olives, you may or may not need the full cup of olive oil.

2. **Marinate the olives:** Set the sealed jar in the refrigerator for at least 48 hours, or up to 1 week.

3. **Serve:** 2 hours before serving, remove the olives from the refrigerator to bring them to room temperature. Transfer to your favorite serving bowl. Enjoy them on their own, or serve along with crackers, charcuterie, or on a holiday cheese board.

4. **Storage:** Store the marinated olives in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.
