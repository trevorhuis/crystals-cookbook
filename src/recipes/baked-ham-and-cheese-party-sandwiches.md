# Baked Ham and Cheese Party Sandwiches

## Ingredients

- Â½ cup melted butter
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds or poppy seeds
- 1 tablespoon dried minced onion
- 12 to 24 mini sandwich rolls (enough to fill a 13x9 pan)
- 1 pound thinly sliced cooked deli ham (could add salami)
- 1 pound thinly sliced Swiss cheese (or other kind)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish.

2. In a bowl, mix together butter, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, poppy seeds, and dried onion. Separate the tops from bottoms of the rolls, and place the bottom pieces into the prepared baking dish. Arrange the meat & cheese on bottom of roll, and top with remaining ham slices in a layer. Place the tops of the rolls onto the sandwiches. Pour the mustard mixture evenly over the rolls.

3. Bake in the preheated oven until the rolls are lightly browned and the cheese has melted, about 20 minutes. Bake 10 minutes loosely covered, 10 minutes uncovered.
