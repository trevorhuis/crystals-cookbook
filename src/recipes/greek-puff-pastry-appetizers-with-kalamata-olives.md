# Greek Puff Pastry Appetizers with Kalamata Olives

Puff pastry shells are baked and filled with a mixture of kalamata olives, red bell pepper, fresh oregano, feta, and spinach with a lemony olive oil vinaigrette for a scrumptious puff pastry appetizer perfect for any holiday party.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup chopped Lindsay Greek Kalamata Olives
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh red bell pepper
- 2 sprigs fresh oregano, leaves removed and minced
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- salt to taste, if desired
- 2/3 cup feta cheese, crumbled
- 2 teaspoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice
- 5 ounces fresh spinach
- 2 packages frozen Puff Pastry Shells

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.

2. Remove the puff pastry shells from the packaging. Bake and remove "tops" of the shells according to package instructions - bake at 400 degrees F for approximately 15 - 20 minutes. The shells should be nicely puffed and golden.

3. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the olives, bell pepper, oregano, pepper, salt (if desired), and feta. Stir to combine. Set aside.

4. In a non-stick skillet, heat the olive oil and lemon juice over medium-high heat. Add the spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until just wilted. Remove from heat. Chop spinach and add to olive mixture. Stir to combine. Set aside.

5. After shells have baked, remove the "top" of the shell using a butter knife. Fill each shell with two heaping tablespoons of the olive mixture. Return the shells (now stuffed) to the oven and bake an additional 5 minutes. Remove and serve immediately.

## Notes
The olive stuffing mixture may be made in advance.
