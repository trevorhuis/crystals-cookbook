# Christmas Stollen

## Ingredients

- 1 cup milk
- ½ cup water
- 2/3 cup butter
- 5 ½ to 6 ½ cups flour
- 2/3 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 ½ teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon cardamom
- 2 packages yeast
- 3 eggs
- 1 ¼ cups mixed candied fruits
- ½ cup raisins
- 2 (7 oz packages) almond paste
- 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, heat first 3 ingredients until very warm (120 to 130 degrees) in microwave.

2. In a large bowl, blend warm liquid, 2 ½ cups flour, sugar, salt, cardamom, yeast and eggs at low speed until moistened. Beat 3 minutes at medium speed. By hand, stir in remaining flour and fruits to form a soft dough.

3. On well-floured surface, knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Place dough in greased bowl; turn greased side up. Cover; let rise in warm place until light and doubled in size, about 1 ½ hours.

4. Lightly grease 3 cookie sheets. Punch down dough; divide in thirds. On lightly floured surface, press one portion of dough to a 12x7 inch oval. Roll 1/3 of almond paste into a rope and place it on one side of the dough. Gently roll the dough into a loaf. Place the loaf, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

5. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Immediately remove from cookie sheet; cool. Dust cooled loaves with confectioners' sugar and sprinkle with cinnamon.
