# Asparagus Pickles

If you wait longer than the 24-hour minimum chill time before serving, the flavor will continue to improve.

**Yield:** Makes 2 qt. | **Hands-on:** 25 Minutes | **Total:** 25 Minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds fresh asparagus
- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon mustard seeds
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 fresh tarragon sprigs
- 1 1/2 cups white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar

## Directions

1. Trim off bottom of asparagus so that asparagus fits into 2 (1-qt.) sterilized canning jars, leaving 1/2-inch headspace. Discard asparagus ends. Divide salt and next 4 ingredients between jars. Pack trimmed asparagus, pointed ends up, into jars.

2. Bring vinegar, sugar, and 1 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour vinegar mixture over asparagus, filling to 1/2 inch from top. (Fill jars with additional hot water, if needed.) Remove air bubbles; wipe jar rims. Cover with metal lids, and screw on bands. Shake to combine, and chill 24 hours. Store in refrigerator up to 1 month.
