# Sausage-Cheese Muffins

Makes 1 dozen

## Ingredients

- 1 lb Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage
- 3 cups all-purpose baking mix (I use Bisquick)
- 1 ½ cups (6 oz) shredded Cheddar Cheese
- 1 (10 ¾ oz) can condensed cheese soup
- ¾ cup water

## Directions

1. Cook sausage in large skillet until no longer pink. Drain and put on paper towel lined plate.

2. Combine sausage, baking mix, and shredded cheese in large bowl; make a well in center of mixture.

3. Stir together soup and ¾ cup water; add to sausage mixture, stirring just until dry ingredients are moistened. Spoon into lightly greased (I use butter flavored Crisco) muffin pans, filling to tops of cups.

4. Bake at 375 for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly browned.

5. Cool in pan 10 minutes, then on cooling rack.
