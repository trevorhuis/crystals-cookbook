# Bagels

About 3 hours total time.

## Ingredients

- 1 ¼ cups water
- 4 ts yeast
- ½ whole wheat flour
- 1 TB fine sea salt
- 2 ½ - 3 cups bread flour
- 3 quarts water
- 2 TB Barley Malt syrup
- 1 egg white

### Everything Topping (enough for 10 bagels)

- 1 ½ TB of each: poppy seeds, toasted sesame seeds, dried onion, dried garlic flakes (dried onion and garlic can be ordered on Amazon)
- 2 ts coarse salt

## Directions

1. Combine water and yeast in electric heavy mixing bowl. Stir and let stand 3 minutes, stir again. Add whole wheat flour, salt and half the white flour. Knead with dough hook until combined, then add the rest of flour.

2. Knead by hand on floured board into ball. Place in oiled bowl and prove 1 to 1 ½ hours.

3. Deflate dough and cut into 10 pieces (2½ oz each). Flatten each with heel of hand, then form into balls. Prove 10 minutes.

4. Shape into bagels. Prove 10 minutes.

5. Preheat oven to 425, middle rack. Boil water and syrup. Boil on each side 30 seconds. **Drain on rack, don't just lay on a pan**. Remove excess water if necessary, before baking.

6. Brush all with egg white and dip some in everything mixture if desired.

7. Bake on large baking pan with silicone sheet (not parchment paper, I tried it and the bagels stuck badly) until lightly golden. 15-20 minutes

There is a video at this link which is worth watching to see how to shape the bagels. Also, it has topping ideas. I am not using her recipe. I tried it, but the recipe above I found to be better.
