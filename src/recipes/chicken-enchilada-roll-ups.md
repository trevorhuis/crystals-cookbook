# Chicken Enchilada Roll Ups

Yield: 80 rolls

## Ingredients

### Main Recipe
- 2 (8-oz) packages cream cheese, softened
- 1 1/2 cups shredded Mexican cheese
- 2 tablespoons Old El Paso taco seasoning
- 2 cups shredded chicken (rotisserie chicken works well)
- 1 (10-oz) can diced tomatoes with green chilies, well drained
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 4 green onions sliced
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- 8 burrito sized tortillas

### DIY Taco Seasoning (Old El Paso Style)
- 1/4 cup chili powder
- 1 tablespoon + 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 tablespoon sea salt
- 1 tablespoon ground black pepper
- 2 teaspoons garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine all of the ingredients (except tortillas) until well blended.

2. Spread about Â½ cup of the mixture over the entire surface of a tortilla. Roll up tightly. Repeat with remaining tortillas.

3. Refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes. Also, if you chill longer they will be easier to cut.

4. Slice into 1/2 inch slices with a serrated knife to prevent crushing and serve.
