# Cheese Ball Bites

## Ingredients

- 8 slices bacon
- 1 (8-oz.) block cream cheese, softened (substitute some creamy blue)
- 1 cup shredded cheddar
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/3 cup freshly chopped chives
- 1/3 cup finely chopped pecans
- 18 pretzel sticks

## Directions

1. In a large nonstick skillet, cook bacon until crispy, 8 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, then finely chop. Set aside.

2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together cream cheese, cheddar cheese, garlic powder, and paprika and season with salt and pepper. Use a cookie scoop to form mixture into 18 small balls and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Refrigerate until firm, 1 hour.

3. In a shallow bowl, stir together bacon, chives, and pecans.

4. Roll balls in bacon-chive-pecan mixture, insert a pretzel stick into each, and let come to room temperature 15 minutes before serving. (If not serving right away, loosely cover with plastic wrap and return to fridge.)
